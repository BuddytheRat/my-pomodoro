Custom Command Line Pomodoro Timer
==================================
Found myself using an online pomodoro and keeping
track of work completed in notepad. Decided to make
my own pomodoro timer with extra features.

Current Features:
- Variable timer length.
- Alarm sound. (.wav file not included in repo)
- Timer runs on separate thread. 
- Pause and resume.
- Keep track of Pomodoros completed.
- Keep track of breaks taken.
- 5 minute break period for each pomodoro session. (5 minute warning sound.)
- Tracks daily and total pomodoros and break time.
- Saves time sheet to file.
- See start and end times for each pomodoro.

Planned Features:
- See stats for the day/week/month/etc.
- GUI?
