Custom Command Line Pomodoro Timer
==================================
Found myself using an online pomodoro and keeping
track of work completed in notepad. Decided to make
my own pomodoro timer with extra features.

Current Features:
- Variable timer length.
- Alarm sound. (.wav file not included in repo)
- Percentage complete.
- Timer runs on separate thread. 
- Pause and resume.
- Pick new timer at timer end. Either a break or another pomodoro.
- Keep track of Pomodoros completed.
- Keep track of breaks taken.
- Enter in number of hours. Automatically divide into work and break periods with timers for each.
- 5 minute break period for each pomodoro session. (5 minute warning sound.)

Planned Features:
- Variable length breaks.
- GUI
